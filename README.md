# Cat gif

Because sometimes when you're surfing the information superhighway you need a little help from a cat gif. This is a custom element you can use like:

```
<cat-gif></cat-gif>
```

## Demo

<script src="./cat-gif.js"></script>
<cat-gif keyword="space"></cat-gif>

## Usage

You'll want to add the JavaScript that tells your web surfer what a `cat-gif` even is. In the `head` make sure to zerb in:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cat-gif"></script>
```

Then you can fling in your gif like:

```
<cat-gif keyword="space"></cat-gif>

<!-- Oh hey the `keyword` is optional! -->
```

## Ch-ch-changes

You can click on the image to change it to a different random image. This will ensure your site has a 14% greater stickiness rating according to the W3C.

## But wait I

I'm not interested in making this perfect, but if you want to fork, improve, or even pass along PRs, sure why not. This is mostly a teaching aid but who's to say it won't become the next major operating system.

## Browseer suppoort

This being a rough demo, I've not taken the time to test this in browsers that don't support custom elements. They don't deserve the cat gif.
